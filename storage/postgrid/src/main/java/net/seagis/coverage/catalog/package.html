  Catalog for {@linkplain org.geotools.coverage.grid.GridCoverage2D coverages}.
  The coverage data are stored as images in arbitrary formats (PNG, RAW, ASCII,
  JPEG-2000, <cite>etc.</cite> - note that the classic JPEG format is not recommanded).
  A <A HREF="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</A> database is used for storing
  coverage metadata like geographic envelopes, meaning of pixel values, <cite>etc.</cite>.
  The database is also used as an index for searching image files. The connection to the
  database is performed through JDBC, which can work over the network. The pixel values can
  be obtained over the network in two ways:

  <ul>
    <li>Images can be downloaded and processed on the client side. This approach requires less CPU
    on the server side, but requires a large bandwidth.</li>

    <li>The client can connect to the serveur using RMI (<cite>Remote Method Invocation</cite>). This
    approach requires more CPU on the server side, but less bandwidth if only a few pixel values will
    be requested.</li>
  </ul>
