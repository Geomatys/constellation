    Private package for utilities classes. This package is used internally by some classes
    in public packages. <strong>Do not use. Classes in this package may change in incompatible
    ways in any future version</strong>. Most classes are just workaround for some Java shortcoming.
    They will be removed when a more standard approach will be available.
