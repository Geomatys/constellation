  <BODY>
  Base classes for the {@linkplain org.constellation.coverage.catalog coverage catalog}
  and the {@linkplain org.constellation.observation.catalog observation catalog}. Those
  base classes provide helper methods for a catalog backed by a SQL database.

  <P>{@link org.constellation.catalog.Element} is the parent of all interfaces providing an
  access to the catalog. Implementations may delegate their work to a remote server,
  using a JDBC query in most cases, or using RMI (<cite>Remote Method Invocation</cite>)
  in a few other cases (for example when a single pixel is evaluated in a grid coverage;
  we don't want to transfer the full image through the network. Note that <cite>Web
  Coverage Service</cite> is an other way to provide the same functionality).</P>

  <P>{@link org.constellation.catalog.Entry} is the root class of most {@link org.constellation.catalog.Element}
  implementations. It is often (but not always) a record from a {@link org.constellation.catalog.Table},
  which is why it is named {@code Entry}.</P>
