    <ul>
      <li>

         <pre>&lt;Dimension name="elevation" units="CRS:88" unitSymbol="m" default="500" multipleValues="false" nearestValue="true"/&gt;500,490,480&lt;/Dimension&gt;</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

         It may also set a default value and/or set current="true".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="dataset">Test Dataset Description</a></h2>
    <p>
      <a href="data-wms-1.3.0.zip">Download the test dataset</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the dataset is based on the
      <a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=7587&amp;version=2">
        Conformance Test Guidelines for OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for SQL, Revision 1.0
      </a>.  This set of features makes up a map of a fictional location called Blue Lake.
      The features are as described in the Simple Features Specification for SQL document,
      except they have been converted to WGS84 coordinates and have been reoriented so the
      area is centered at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.
      Figure 1 shows an overview map of the area with the prominent features labeled.
      Figure 2 shows the location of each of the data points.
    </p>
    <table>
      <caption align="bottom">Figure 1:  Overview of Blue Lake vicinity features</caption>
      <tr><td><img src="images/bluelake_features.gif" alt="overview"/></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p/>
    <table border="1">
      <caption align="bottom">Figure 2:  Blue Lake vicinity data points</caption>
      <tr><td><img src="images/bluelake_coordinates.gif" alt="blue lake data"/></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Additional features have also been defined to test data at a larger scale.
      These consist of a diamond and two overlapping squares, as shown in figure 3.
      It does not matter which square appears on top.<br/>
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <caption align="bottom">Figure 3:  Basic Polygon Features</caption>
      <tr><td><img src="images/basic_polygons.gif" alt="basic polygons data"/></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      More features have also been defined to test dimensional data.
      To support testing the elevation dimension using terrain coverage data, a terrain dataset derived from DTED data has been defined.  It has values that range from 0 to 425m that include a "high spot" with values &gt; 325m and a "low spot" with values &lt; 200m.  The remainder of the dataset is filled with values between 200m and 325m, including a few values that are exactly 250m.  It covers a one degree square area, centered at 0,0.
      To support testing the elevation dimension using vector data, additional polygons representing the edge of the lake at other depths have been defined.
      To support testing the time dimension, point geometries that represent the locations of automobiles along the roads at 5 second increments during a one minute interval have been defined.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The features are organized into layers as shown in table below.  The layers may be named
      in any fashion, but must be titled exactly as shown in the table.<br/>
