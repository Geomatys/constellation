		<h2>WMS 1.1.1 Test Data Definition</h2>
		<p>
			The majority of the CITE standard dataset is based on the
			<a target="otherwindow" href="http://www.opengis.org/testing/docs/98-046r1.rtf">
				Conformance Test Guidelines for OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for SQL, Revision 1.0
			</a>.  This set of features makes up a map of a fictional location called Blue Lake.
			The features are as described in the Simple Features Specification for SQL document,
			except they have been converted to WGS84 coordinates and have been reoriented so the
			area is centered at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.
			Figure 1 shows an overview map of the area with the prominent features labeled.
			Figure 2 shows the location of each of the data points.<br/>

			<br/>
			Additional features have also been defined to test data at a larger scale.
			These consist of a diamond and two overlapping squares, as shown in figure 3.
			It does not matter which square appears on top.<br/>

			The features are organized into layers as shown in table 1.  The layers may be named
			in any fashion, but must be titled exactly as shown in the table.<br/>
